        <h2>Many faces</h2>
        <p>One of the more frequent conditions we deal with is the multiple personality disorder.
            It is one of the more peculiar cases, for it splits the self into many different personae.
            Each persona has its own memory, consciousness and behavior. Our last client was a special case.
             Lingua Clavis came to us with a complaint that he has multiple personae in his head.
            But the interesting part is that his personalities all speak a different language.
            His wife has heard him speak Spanish, German, Latin, Vietnamese and a language that even she does not know,
            which she believes to be the key to it all.
            This has made Clavis so afraid that he can't even look in the mirror in the morning,
            because he can never be sure who looks back. </p>
        <p>When dealing with people like Clavis you have to assure them that all of the personae are still him.
            So now 1 will leave you with one question: Who do you see when you look in the mirror?
