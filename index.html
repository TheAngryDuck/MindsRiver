            <p>
            This is a peculiar little puzzle game. It will take you onto a website of a fictional company.
            When you arrive there you will be met with puzzles of all shapes and sizes.
            By solving them you learn what the company is about and what it is doing. But are things always the way they seem?

            <h3>Tips</h3>
            <p id="tips">
                <b> 1)</b> We strongly advise you to take this journey on a <b>computer</b> and on <b>google chrome</b> because some parts of the game may not work on another browser.<br>
               <b> 2)</b> The use of an old school pen and paper can be helpful for taking notes or saving your progress.<br>
               <b> 3)</b> Think outside the box. Nothing exists there without a reason. Getting stuck is only the beginning.<br>
                <b>4)</b> Since puzzles are like problems, try to approach them like you would any other.<br>
                <b>5)</b> If you find yourself in need of help contact on facebook at <b>MindsRiver</b>
